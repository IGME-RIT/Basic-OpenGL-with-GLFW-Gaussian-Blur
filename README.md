# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Gaussian Blur

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

Building off of the previous example where we rendered to a texture, we use that texture to apply a post process effect.

Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.
